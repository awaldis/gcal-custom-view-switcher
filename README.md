# Google Calendar Custom View Switcher

"Custom View" refers to the number of days displayed on the calendar.  Without this automation, you need to go into the settings to change this value.  This script puts buttons on the main calendar page that automatically change the value and saves a few clicks and some scrolling.

Currently, there are two buttons that set the custom view to 4 days or 7 days.

This code was developed for and has only been tested on desktop Firefox.  It requires the script to be installed in the "Tampermonkey" extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and of course you have to have Tampermonkey installed in Firefox.

Significant caveat - this code was developed without any approval or coordination from Google.  Google can change their calendar web app code at any time and in a way that might break this code.
